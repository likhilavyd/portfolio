        I am a B.Tech student in Electronics & Communication Engineering - Artificial Intelligence 
        at IGDTUW with a strong interest in software development and technology-driven problem solving. 
        I enjoy building practical, user-focused web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, 
        and backend technologies, and I continuously work on improving my projects beyond basic prototypes.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
        Alongside web development, I have a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms, 
        object-oriented programming, and core electronics concepts such as analog and digital electronics, 
        signals and systems, and network analysis. I have also explored data science using R, 
        gaining experience in data analysis and visualization.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
        I actively participate in technical societies, hackathons, and open-source initiatives, 
        which has helped me develop strong collaboration, communication, and leadership skills. 
        I am passionate about learning, experimenting with new technologies, and building solutions 
        that create real-world impact.
